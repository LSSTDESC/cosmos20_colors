====================
The cosmos20_colors package was not developed as part of the COSMOS-20 collaboration.
The approximate models of summary statistics of COSMOS-20 galaxies were developed
based on catalogs made publicly available
via `the COSMOS-20 collaboration website <https://cosmos2020.calet.org/>`_.
