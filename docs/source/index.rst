Welcome to the cosmos20_colors documentation
============================================
The `cosmos20_colors <https://github.com/aphearin/cosmos20_colors/>`__ package
builds approximate models for the distributions of luminosity
and color of galaxies in the COSMOS-20 dataset. These approximate models are intended
to be used as rough target data for calibrating models of the galaxy--halo connection.

**Disclaimer:** Note that the cosmos20_colors package was not developed
as part of the COSMOS-20 collaboration. Please see the citation information below
