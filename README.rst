cosmos20_colors
===============
The cosmos20_colors package builds approximate models for the distributions of luminosity
and color of galaxies in the COSMOS-20 dataset. These approximate models are intended
to be used as rough target data for calibrating models of the galaxy--halo connection.

**Disclaimer:** Note that the cosmos20_colors package was not developed
as part of the COSMOS-20 collaboration. Please see the citation information below
if you use this package in your research.


Installation
------------
To install cosmos20_colors into your environment from the source code::

    $ cd /path/to/root/cosmos20_colors
    $ python setup.py install


Environment configuration
-------------------------
The following step is not required, but we recommend you create an environment
variable COSMOS20_DRN with the directory where the dataset is stored on your disk.
To do this, add the following line to your .bash_profile (for bash users)
or .zshrc (for zshell users)::

    export COSMOS20_DRN="/path/to/drn/containing/cosmos20/data"


Downloading the data
--------------------
The official release of the COSMOS-20 dataset is publicly available
on `the COSMOS-20 collaboration website <https://cosmos2020.calet.org/>`_.
The version of the catalog that is intended to be used with this package
can be downloaded `here <https://portal.nersc.gov/project/hacc/aphearin/cosmos20_colors/>`_.


Reading the data
----------------
Once you have downloaded the data, installed the package,
and created the COSMOS20_DRN environment variable, launch a new terminal
so that the variable is activated, and launch a python interpreter.
To load the dataset into memory:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from cosmos20_colors import load_cosmos20
    >>> galaxies = load_cosmos20()


Testing
-------
To run the suite of unit tests::

    $ cd /path/to/root/cosmos20_colors
    $ pytest
